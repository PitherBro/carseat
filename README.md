# Proof of Concept Website

A simple nodejs website that was hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for an elementry school colaboration project.

I was contacted by an elementry school teacher who was looking for a programmer to suport an elementry girl's science fair project.
They needed to organize with an outside source(me) to demonstrate a proof of concept for a carseat safty feature.

I created this simple interactive webpage which demonstrated the abstract logic required for the program to function.
They featured it at their science fair where she won 1st place.

## The Project

Wanted a proof of concept for a phone application that would detect if a mother left their child in a car over a period of 1 minute.

The application would use a small device (probably bluetooth linked) to determine if the phone was a distance (5 meters away).

If so it would send an alert to the phone to make sure the mother did not leave the child behind.

If no response was given would alert the local authorities.

# Running

Simply ensure nodejs is installed, 

use `npm i` to install packages
- express

The rest of the functionality is done in basic HTML and Javascript to make the program easily portable and runnable from anywhere.

Nodejs is not requrired to access and view webpage, but does allow for hosting.
